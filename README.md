I Am The Answer
============

#### Prologue ####

"I Am The Answer" is a famous dialogue from the Malayalam cult comedy movie *[Mazha Peyyunnu Maddhalam Kottunnu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazha_Peyyunnu_Maddalam_Kottunnu)* directed by Priyadarshan. There will be only very few Malayalees(people from the state of Kerala in India) who would not have seen that movie. The YouTube link of that famous scene is available [here](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2tRL7r3uSE).

The intention of this project is to be a database of Malayalam Movie Dialogues like an IMDb is for Movies. This is a small step, starting with Malayalam language, but can be enhanced for other languages as well and hence I intend to make this as an open source project. 

#### Backend ####

I Am The Answer is a web application based on the MEAN stack. MEAN stack is the abbreviation of MongoDB, ExpressJS, AngularJS and NodeJS 

#### Frontend ####

This web application is built using NodeJS, AngularJS and has used Yeoman for scaffolding (`yo`), building (`grunt`) and package management (`bower`). I use PassportJS for Security layer, and logging using Google, Facebook and Twitter will be implemented

2. Install NodeJS
3. Install Yeoman - `npm install -g yo`
