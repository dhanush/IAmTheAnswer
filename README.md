I Am The Answer
============

#### Prologue ####

"I Am The Answer" is the famous dialogue from the Malayalam cult comedy movie *[Mazha Peyyunnu Maddhalam Kottunnu](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mazha_Peyyunnu_Maddalam_Kottunnu)* directed by Priyadarshan. There will be only very few Malayalees(people from the state of Kerala in India) who would not have seen that movie.

The intention of this project is to become a database of Malayalam Movie Dialogues like an IMDb is for Movies. This is a small step, starting with Malayalam language, but can be enhanced for other languages as well and hence I intend to make this as an open source project.
